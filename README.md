Hi! I'm Lakshya Raj (lraj22) :wave:

I'm a dev who has experience with web tech and Python, but apart from that, I also do C/C++ and PHP. Occasionally, when I need to, I can write Windows and shell scripts.

Nevertheless, I'm fascinated by EVERYTHING about software development - it's so interesting! I want to learn as much as possible about every programming language that is used to make the world's software. Of course, that comes with time. :smile:

I'm also [on Stack Overflow][stack_profile] and [LinkedIn][linkedin_profile]. Check those places out!

Well, that's basically me. You can see more about the stuff I do and make from my code, both here and around the internet. Anyways, I hope to see you around GitHub!

Happy coding! üê±‚Äçüíª
