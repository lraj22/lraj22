Hi! I'm Lakshya Raj (@lraj22) :wave::sunglasses:

I'm currently working on anything that's related to web technologies. HTML, CSS, JS, Node, extensions made with JS, etc. Basically, if you can somehow get JavaScript into it, I want to see how. :joy:

Nevertheless, I'm interested in EVERYTHING about coding - it's so interesting! I want to learn as much as possible about every programming language that is used to make the world's software. Of course, that comes with time. :smile:

The projects that I make that make use of server side Node JS can be found on [my Glitch profile](https://glitch.com/@lraj) (plus some other cool things that are just client side). I'm also [on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/u/14469685/). Check those places out too! :airplane:

Well, that's basically me. You can see more about the stuff I do and make from my repositories. I'll see you around GitHub sometimes. :eyes:

Happy coding! üê±‚Äçüíª
