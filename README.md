Hi! I'm @lraj22 👋😎

I'm currently working on anything that's related to web technologies. HTML, CSS, JS, Node, extensions made with JS, etc. Basically, if you can somehow get JavaScript into it, I want to see how. 😂

Nevertheless, I'm interested in EVERYTHING about coding - it's so interesting! I want to learn as much as possible about every programming language that is used to make the world's software. Of course, that comes with time. 😄

Not too much to say, and not much time to be idle, either. Well, I'll see you around GitHub sometimes. 👀

Happy coding! 🐱‍💻
