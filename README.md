Hi! I'm Lakshya Raj (lraj22) :wave:

I'm a dev who has experience with web tech and some Python, but apart from that, I also do C/C++ and PHP. Occasionally, when I need to, I can write Batch and PowerShell scripts.

Nevertheless, I'm fascinated by EVERYTHING about software development - it's so interesting! I want to learn as much as possible about every programming language that is used to make the world's software. Of course, that comes with time. :smile:

My server-side projects can be found on [my Glitch profile][glitch_profile] (plus some other cool things that are just client side). I'm also [on Stack Overflow][stack_profile]. Check those places out too!

Well, that's basically me. You can see more about the stuff I do and make from my code, both here and on Glitch. Anyways, I hope to see you around GitHub!

Happy coding! üê±‚Äçüíª
