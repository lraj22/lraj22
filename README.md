Hi! I'm Lakshya Raj (@lraj22) :wave::sunglasses:

I'm a dev who has experience with Python and web technologies, but apart from that, I also do C/C++, PHP, and SQL. Occasionally, when I need to, I can script in Batch. I'm still looking into learning Java and Unity. :computer:

Nevertheless, I'm fascinated by EVERYTHING about software development - it's so interesting! I want to learn as much as possible about every programming language that is used to make the world's software. Of course, that comes with time. :smile:

The projects that I make that make use of server side Node JS can be found on [my Glitch profile](https://glitch.com/@lraj) (plus some other cool things that are just client side). I'm also [on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/u/14469685/). Check those places out too! :airplane:

Well, that's basically me. You can see more about the stuff I do and make from my repositories. I'll see you around GitHub sometimes. :eyes:

Happy coding! üê±‚Äçüíª
